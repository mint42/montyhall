# MONTYHALL

If you're not familiar with the monty hall problem, I suggest you read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) first.

This is a little program that runs the experiment x amount of times to prove why you should always switch doors.

## Getting Started

To clone this code to your machine, run `git clone https://github.com/mint42/montyhall` in your terminal, in the folder of your choosing.

An executable has been provided for simplicity, but feel free to create a new one with gcc or clang. The executable can be found at the root of the repository.

```
usage: ./montyhall [iterations]
